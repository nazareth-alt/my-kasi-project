# Project Title
My kasi project
## Description
A short description of what this project does and its objectives.
I aimed to fix the following issues

The website lacks clear structure and detailed information about the business, including the companyâ€™s vision and mission. Navigation is difficult due to scattered navbar items.Pricing, shipping fees, and discounts should be displayed for transparency and better customer experience. The visual design could be improved with high-quality images and more whitespace, along with a colorful theme to match the products. The website is not responsive, causing layout issues on different screen sizes, and the banner background does not clearly convey the product being sold.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/nazareth-alt/my-kasi-project.git)
